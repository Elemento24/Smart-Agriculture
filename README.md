# AgroTech | Modernizing Agriculture Everywhere

This is our team-project for the hackathon **Zeitgeist'21** organized by **IIT-Ropar**. The team consisted of 4 members, and we secured the [2nd Position](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1631blGdfqp4Jmbi2JM_8LzY24VNuVzQH/view) in the hackathon. The members of the team were as follows:
- [Vishesh Mittal](https://github.com/Elemento24)
- [Aditya Raj](https://github.com/Adityahulk)
- [Arpit Agarwal](https://github.com/aarpit1010)
- [Harsh Mahajan](https://github.com/harsh-8989)

## Our Aim
- As time passed, more technological advances appeared in **agriculture**. The tractor was introduced, followed by new tillage and harvesting equipment, irrigation and air seeding technology, all leading to higher yields and improved quality of the food and fibre that was grown. 
- Nowadays, people call **Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence** as the **new electricity**. Hence, our aim is to equip agriculture with the jolting advantages of this new electricity.
- We brainstormed with all the possible enhancements that ML & AI has to offer in the agricultural sector, and we tailored the ML pipeline as per the enhancements.
- The features used were **complex**, but were made to be **very simple to use** and **friendly** and also **interactive**.

## About the Project

This project is made as a step towards integrating **AI revolution with Agriculture**. It facilitates smart agriculture with features like **chatbot for queries**, **integrated crop and fertilizer recommendation system** and **prediction of plant disease transmission**. This software is ready to be deployed on servers and clouds .
The software pipeline of project can be considered of **mapping of three parts**:
- Machine Learning, Deep learning, transformer, etc. model training, saving and inference deployment.
- Django Backend AI integration, backend programming, module development and admin preparation
- Front end development, feature designing and integration
